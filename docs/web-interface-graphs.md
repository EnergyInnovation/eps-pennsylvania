title:  "Output Graphs Available in the Web Interface"
---

The web interface allows the user to visualize Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) results through a variety of output graphs.  As of EPS 3.0.0, there are 152 different output graphs available in the web interface.  However, which graphs are shown in the web interface may be customized for different EPS country or regional adaptations.  Many graphs include more than one data series, such as a graph of power plant capacity by plant type (coal, nuclear, hydro, etc.).  Therefore, over 600 different data series are available in the web interface.  (Thousands more are available in the [downloadable version](download.html) of the EPS.)

Here is a list of the graphs that are available for the EPS web interface as of version 3.0.0:
